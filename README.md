Discord Bot using OpenAI's API integration and GPT-3.5_turbo model
Introduction
This project is a Discord bot that takes queries from a Discord text channel as prompts and replies with the answers in human-like language using OpenAI's API integration and the GPT-3.5_turbo language model. The bot was developed as part of a workshop arranged by GFG_KIIT and uses Python as the programming language.
